Great performance,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cool processor,2 April 2024,Cool processor,Positive
It can be more efficient I guess,3.0 out of 5 stars,"It is working almost same as my 10 yr old DELL XPS laptop, swapped with a SATA SSD, and i7 second gen processor. I don't know whats improved. But it's doing its job I guess.. in my 2 weeks of usage I have seen it's temprature rised above 80¬∞C once. Wasn't expecting that from current refined and powerful generations. I am using liquid cooling on top of this. And yet it hit 80¬∞C. What I was doing when that happened was trying to open a game. And one thing that I missed was to disable the integrated graphics because I have dedicated GPU. It was just for a moment the CPU was used during the game launch and after it started using the GPU. But until that switch happened, under less than a minute of CPU usage, it reached to 80¬∞c. I mean since these are premium products, there should be some protection layers blocking such usages, and close the programs instead rather than hitting its performance.But anyways, I disabled the integrated device and then it's all smooth. Everything normal except for that one instance explained above. Parallel processing is still shitty though with Windows OS. Same kind of processors on Mac before Apple silicon came in were working more efficiently. So I guess it's prob with windows OS, but not processors.",10 November 2023,"working almost 10 yr old DELL XPS laptop , swapped SATA SSD , i7 second gen processor . n't know whats improved .

No title,No rating,"We set up multiple computing servers to run heavy video processing algorithms essentially continuously everyday - to make a long story short, we liked how fast this ran compared to the i7-11th gen we had from before.The surprising thing is one day among 8 essentially identical machines, we noticed one desktop that seemed much hotter than the others.  We hooked up measurement of power draw and temperature readings of the CPUs and was shocked that this one was drawing 450W as others were showing < 200W.  And temperature went up to 100C while the others were at 70C.One system had a glitch where if you ran python and import numpy, it would reboot.  We determined the problem was that PSU only supported +12V rail at 20A.  We switched to a 600W PSU that supports +12V @50A and it worked flawlessly.  So watch out that your PSU supplies sufficient amps at +12V.Ordered a replacement, replacement brand new would not boot up.  We swapped back old CPU from, and it boots up but runs hot again.  This one we had to reduce workload to 75% of other systems to cool it down.So 2 out of 10 desktops are defective  This is a huge surprise.

No title,No rating,"So, first thing's first. This is a genuinely powerful CPU that's been able to handle basically every task that I've thrown at it. It runs demanding tasks like encoding and gaming with ease.Now with that out of the way; Thermals. This thing gets hot, and I mean REALLY hot. If you're going with air cooling I strongly recommend a double tower, six/eight pipe Air cooler like the Corsair A115 or a Cooler Master MA824. If you are going the AIO route, anything LESS than a 360mm AIO will under perform. For that, go with any 360mm AIO from any brand of your choice. If you have the space, go with a 420mm AIO for the best results.Finally, there has been recent reports of CPU degradation and instability when using this CPU. I am using this with an asus ROG STRIX Z790-H motherboard and it basically JUICED the CPU like no tomorrow until I applied intel's Power settings for this CPU. This likely is the cause of the degradation. Be sure to check intel's website for recommended power settings. Also check your motherboard vendor for any bios updates as Intel has confirmed that many motherboard vendors are running the i9 13900k CPU out of intel's specifications.In conclusion here's my personal experience: The CPU functions, but I can not use Asus' AI Overclocking feature as I get a BSOD with the CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT error and apps will randomly crash. You probably shouldn't use any AI assisted overclocking feature if you can help it. Even running this at stock, there is still a substantial amount of performance in this CPU. If you have an older rig and are looking to upgrade your CPU, I would just wait for Meteorlake or just go with AMD.Final note: I am not using a contact frame on my motherboard for my CPU.",26 May 2024,", first thing 's first . genuinely powerful CPU 's able handle basically every task 've thrown . runs demanding tasks like encoding gaming ease.Now way ; Thermals . thing gets hot , mean REALLY hot .
