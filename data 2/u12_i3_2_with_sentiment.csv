No title,No rating,"The Intel Core i3-12100 processor from the 12th generation brings a breath of fresh air to compact NAS systems.As an entry-level chip of the current Alder Lake architecture, it not only offers sufficient computing power for demanding server tasks, but also convinces with a very efficient energy balance. The modern hybrid design made of four performance and four efficiency corses enables always balanced operation.Demanding tasks such as video transcoding, multitasking or containerization are mastered via the fast P-cores with a high clock rate.For less complex background processes, the electricity-saving e-cores take over the job.
