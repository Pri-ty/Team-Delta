Great process but pathetic Stock cooler,4.0 out of 5 stars,"The cpu is overall great for everything, it‚Äôll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming. If you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy. But the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler. First of all I would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling. So be careful with the stock cooler, or I would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like India where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you don‚Äôt have an ac in your room, aio is the choice.",3 April 2022,"cpu overall great everything , ‚Äô give flaw less performance mediocre level video editing hardcore level gaming streaming . looking buy gaming perfect buy . thing disappointing stock cooler .
