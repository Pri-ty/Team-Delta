A superb piece of a processor,5.0 out of 5 stars,"No doubt, 12th gen Intel processors are a marvel of computing technology. Although there is a continuing tug of war between Intel and AMD in this regard. I personally chose Intel Core i7 (12700K) with inbuilt UHD graphics for my newly built desktop PC. For those, who don't want to use a separate and usually exorbitantly priced graphics cards, this processor is a very good alternative. It can handle most of the processing intensive rendering of Blender easily with its unlocked overclocking (obviously you have to use the supporting motherboard, i.e. presently available Z690 chipset motherboards). It can also smoothly handle almost all the tasks of Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop with no hiccups. Not to mention the support of 4K video with HDR if you are looking for some decent and the latest entertainment in your PC. I would suggest this 12th Gen i7 to those who want to use their PC for content creation purpose in the best possible way and also at the same time save some money (compared to 12th Gen i9, which would ideally be the best anyway, but costlier too). The price is still at a high level. Hopefully this comes down soon with the launch of Intel's 13th Gen processors!",28 June 2022,"doubt , 12th gen Intel processors marvel computing technology .

No title,No rating,"It's pretty good value for money (as far as intel CPUs are concerned...) for a 12th gen CPU, but if you're looking for the BETTER value get the i5-13600K which outperforms it at pretty much the same cost while being a 13th gen CPU. The only real downside of the 13600k is that it generally requires a 13th gen compatible motherboard, otherwise you'll need to FLASH THE BIOS on a 12th gen compatible motherboard to update the motherboard for it to be able to read 13th gen CPU (I highly do not recommend doing this). I've tried it a few and it's such a big hassle (many potential issues...)that I recommend first time PC builders or part buyers to just save yourself a headache and buy a 13th gen CPU, along with a 13th gen compatible motherboard (don't buy 12th gen mobo) which obviously doesn't require flashing bios for the 13600k to be usable.",5 August 2023,"'s pretty good value money ( far intel CPUs concerned ... ) 12th gen CPU , 're looking BETTER value get i5-13600K outperforms pretty much cost 13th gen CPU . real downside 13600k generally requires 13th gen compatible motherboard , otherwise 'll need FLASH BIOS 12th gen compatible motherboard update motherboard able read 13th gen CPU ( highly recommend ) .

No title,No rating,"This item has been with me for a very short time.So I recently decided to upgrade my gaming rig, and after extensive research, I made the bold choice to order the Intel Core i7-12700K Gaming Desktop Processor with Integrated Graphics and 12 Cores. Let me tell you, this processor is the absolute best! With its 12 cores, it brings a whole new level of performance to my gaming experience. Whether I'm playing graphically demanding AAA titles or indulging in intense multitasking, this processor effortlessly handles it all. And what's even better is that it comes with integrated graphics, meaning I didn't have to shell out extra cash for a separate graphics card, yet. The integrated Graphics offer the flexibility of running dual displays smoothly without any hiccups. Plus, with Intel's reputation for reliable and high-quality products, I know I can trust the i7-12700K to last me for years to come.I hope you find this review helpful.",5 August 2023,"item short time.So recently decided upgrade gaming rig , extensive research , made bold choice order Intel Core i7-12700K Gaming Desktop Processor Integrated Graphics 12 Cores .

No title,No rating,"So far so good, but then that's what I said about the last one...  I'll check back in a year on this and hope it outlasts my prior CPU.As for the last one... it's Intel dropping the ball with their QC it seems.  Had an IMC function poorly and finally give up the ghost and refuse to post with more than one memory module installed.  Couldn't run any XMP profiles, and swapping the processor solved it (not a Mobo issue).Just watch for funky behavior when you buy this gen, and return it if *anything* seems even *remotely* off.",21 July 2023,"far good , 's said last one ...
