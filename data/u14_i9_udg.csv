No title,No rating,"This is a nice processor that I use in a dev box.  I have it air cooled and can play Minecraft with shaders all day on it with my 4080GTX and 128 gigs of memory.  The only issue I have is probably my own fault, in that I learned that intel did that stunt where they introduced P and E cores.  I'm not sure if they are making straight performance core models by the time I write this but if you are a rabid gamer make sure you are getting that type of proc and not this proc.  Still, this proc will do just fine for me as I use this for hyper-v and development work.  I'm sure it will play all the latest games just fine. and If it doesn't I can just pop in a different proc.",23 June 2024,"nice processor use dev box . air cooled play Minecraft shaders day 4080GTX 128 gigs memory . issue probably fault , learned intel stunt introduced P E cores .

No title,No rating,"After upgrading my PC with the Intel Core i9-14900KF, I can say that this processor is a real power pack.Here are my impressions after intensive use: performance: With its 24 cores and an impressive clock rate, the i9-14900KF delivers an incredible performance.No matter whether with gaming, video editing or multitasking - this processor is effortless.In games like Cyberpunk 2077 and Red Dead Redemption 2, the graphics run buttery, even with the highest settings.The loading times are minimal and the gameplay is absolutely fluid. Multitasking: I often work with several demanding applications at the same time - from Adobe Premiere per Photoshop to Blender.The i9-14900KF copes with these tasks without sweating.Even if I work a video rendering and at the same time in another window on a large image editing project, the system remains reaction quickly and stable.I chose a high -quality water cooling from NZXT (Kraken 360 Elite) to keep the temperatures under control.With this AIO, the processor remains cool and quiet even in intensive gaming sessions or long rendering times. Price-performance ratio: The price of the i9-14900KF is certainly not low, but in view of the performance offered, I think it is justified.For enthusiasts and professionals who need maximum performance, this processor is a worthwhile investment. Fazit: The Intel Core i9-14900KF is an absolute monster in terms of performance.Whether gaming, creative work or multitasking - this processor delivers constant impressive results.The possibility of overclocking offers additional scope for performance enthusiasts.Even if it is a little more expensive and requires good cooling, I am completely satisfied with my choice and can recommend the i9-14900KF to anyone who wants to get the best out of their system.",11 June 2024,"upgrading PC Intel Core i9-14900KF , say processor real power pack.Here impressions intensive use : performance : 24 cores impressive clock rate , i9-14900KF delivers incredible performance.No matter whether gaming , video editing multitasking - processor effortless.In games like Cyberpunk 2077 Red Dead Redemption 2 , graphics run buttery , even highest settings.The loading times minimal gameplay absolutely fluid .

E cores will cause instability in almost every multithreaded application, clocking has to be severely limited to avoid blue screen of death, Intel Extreme Tuning Utility is borderline malware, and the high thread count is just deceptive marketing because 1/3 of the cores are laptop grade.

No title,No rating,Like the idea of no onboard video heating up the processor.  The irony is i have a Asus pro art MB 750 model that does the integration of components. My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago.

No title,No rating,"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.

No title,No rating,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.",3 November 2023,"far good .
