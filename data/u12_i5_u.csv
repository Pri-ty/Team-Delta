My board will accept 12, 13 and 14 gen CPU's so maybe I will update in a few years.",25 December 2023,"built new machine MSI board want spend much .

No title,No rating,"Bought for a Mini-ITX Build for my daughter when it was on sale for $149.99, felt like a nice value for Q4 2023.  Didn't overclock this one, but could as it runs at just 48 degrees Celsius under load from Cinebench R23 with the (just-barely-fits-in-the-case) ThermalRight Peerless Assassin 120 SE ARBG.  Side note: for anybody building a PC, that Peerless Assassin is the CPU air cooling champion at ~$40.  This 12600k processor is more power hungry than some of it's AMD competitors, but having recently purchased an AMD 7800x3d for my own computer that's requiring a bit more work to optimize and get running properly, this 12600k was perfect.  Intel stuff in my experience just tends to run good.",24 December 2023,"Bought Mini-ITX Build daughter sale $ 149.99 , felt like nice value Q4 2023 . n't overclock one , could runs 48 degrees Celsius load Cinebench R23 ( just-barely-fits-in-the-case ) ThermalRight Peerless Assassin 120 SE ARBG .

No title,No rating,"This processor with the rebuild of our desktop build has been very loyal and powerful. Mixed with a DeepCool AK620 and non overclocked I finally figure out the formula too achieve 4K ultra Gaming on most games that I play on a regular basis. I play numerous of strategy games but I do also play Grand Theft Auto (as an escape...) American truck simulator as of late and Roblox. The processing performance has been excellent. I hope that one day I can overclock one of these processors without having to worry about frequencies and voltages. Basically said it's it's 12th generation processor and that's been recent in the past two to three years. It is on the mid-range of the spectrum for Intel i5, but really just seems to automate on its own and it actively will try to lower utilization numbers once it's processed what it has to process. I can go through a hundred tabs an hour and not have to worry about internal latency. It's good",21 December 2023,"processor rebuild desktop build loyal powerful .
