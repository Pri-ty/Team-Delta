No title,No rating,"The best mid -range price quality processor.You have the i5-12400F which is the best price quality if you want something cheaper.The i5-13500 (this processor) if you need more power is the best price quality in this price range, and if you want even something more powerful (one more tad) is the i5-13600kf.These 3 are the best processors of the mid-high quality price.A lot of cane at 50-60.When you do stress tests and put the processor to the maximum for 10 minutes, the temperature is 75-80 degrees.This also depends on other factors such as the box and the ambient temperature, but in no case is a hot processor, with € 40 refrigerators this bug.It brings a dissipator in the box (that of Intel), but I do not recommend it if you are going to put cane, because it is heated a lot, around 20-30 degrees more.
