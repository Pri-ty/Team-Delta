No title,No rating,"Upgrading from i5 6600. My new i3 is so cute im going to nickname it AWESOME! The cooler is very elegant. I hope it works! Thanks! Amazon for fast shipping arriving a day early and packaged nice!I was really excited about the cooler but the mounting mechanism is aweful. It dont clip dont nice now matter how hard i tried. Theres always one last clip just loose. I can reach on the backside and pop it off easily with my finger. I can understand people on a budget and needs to rely on this cooler and intel provides, Thanks! but i switched over to a cheap waterblock and i felt way more at ease.Intel skimped on the thermal paste. upon first installation i tried a game and it throttled my cpu with turbo boost on. I took the cooler off to try another cooler and looked at the paste it barely cover the cpu.I added more paste on top of intel paste and got a 15c drop and no more throttle. If you dont have better cooling solution i advise you get more thermal paste for sure.I test CPU on game COD MW3 before with intel 6600 i get 35-50fps with a lot of micro stutter.now with new intel i3 its getting 80-120fps smooth. and the fps counter saying its only using about 10-15 % cpu activity! im very happy.
