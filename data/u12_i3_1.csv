No title,No rating,"I have this installed into an Asrock motherboard. It works great. I was a little misinformed about the built in graphics and thought when I bought it was I was getting Iris Xe, but it's something called UHD. The product description clearly says UHD, so my bad really. Most of the other Intel 12th gen chips with graphics processing have Iris Xe which has many more graphics processing units. For sure the UHD is fine for many things including streaming video. Not sure about 3D gaming, though. Had I know it was UHD and not Iris, I might have saved $30 or so and bought the version without the graphics. On the other hand, I liked the idea of onboard graphics as a backup or alternative. In either case, this i3 runs like a champ compared to the quad core phenom ii based system it's replacing.I'm not sure it's relevant here but I think I should mention that my Asrock board can't make use of the on board UHD graphics when you set BIOS to legacy mode. You need to use the UEFI mode in order to use the on board graphics. Not sure if that's typical of other boards or board brands. With my Asrock board, you need a discrete graphics card to use the legacy bios mode to boot from an old non-UEFI installation of windows.

No title,No rating,"At 4 cores and 8 threads, this processor is equivalent to the top tier i7 processors of just a few years ago.  Mine is paired with 16 GB of RAM and an RX 6600, and it handles everything I do (1080 gaming) very comfortably.The heat sink that is included is very minimalist, but it does the job. Idle temperature is about 40C and the processor peaks at about 65C under load. That being said, the fan is very audible at max speed (3,000 RPM) to maintain that stable temperature under load. One might be wise to consider a different heat sink on a gaming computer. Almost any air-cooled device would be sufficient.

No title,No rating,"How many of you just need a fast processor for standard home/office work? Buy this and call it a day.If you need something to handle Microsoft Office, any browser (your internet connection matters more), and basic applications, the 12100 is all you need. Loading time is very good. You really don't need amazing graphics to perform any of these tasks. I'm using integrated video and it suits me just fine. My other computer uses the APU on an AMD 5600G and I've never had issues. I paired this CPU with a barebones Gigabyte motherboard (cheapest I could find) and 8GB of DDR4 memory and it rivals my AMD setup for plain tasks.Don't feel like you need an i5, i7, or even the i3 12400 if you just need an everyday computer for watching videos, doing online banking, or crunching out work material (unless you are editing heavy media). This i3-12100 is the equivalent of a quad core processor from years back. If you are working on virtual machines, doing strong programming, have a million windows open, need to use Adobe Creative Suite to quickly produce and export content, then you may want to consider moving up to a stronger processor. Even so, this one is still pretty good - it will just take longer to complete some things.I'm overall very happy with this processor and I think most households who have similar requirements will be satisfied. The 12400 did get to $160 at some point so that could be something to look at to future proof a machine since it has six cores (not that I need them right now).",19 May 2022,"many need fast processor standard home/office work ?
