No title,No rating,"After a mainboard defect, I unfortunately had to transfer my old ASUS P5B to disposal, together with the installed Core 2 quad.This combination for a business and home office PC was still completely okay under Windows 10.Only the change to Windows 11 would have made a hardware update necessary sooner or later ... which was now accelerated by the defect, which should describe my requirement profile, so to speak.And that fulfills the 13100f.I don't need onboard graphics, with 3 monitors I can't avoid a graphics card anyway.The CPU is comparatively cheap and it is more than fast enough for my purposes.The low power hunger makes the PC run almost silently and promises a long service life.Experience has shown that there is even some undervolting that should improve these things again. It fits the cost -effective CPU for my purposes.I would not call up the higher potential of more expensive processors anyway.",10 September 2023,"mainboard defect , unfortunately transfer old ASUS P5B disposal , together installed Core 2 quad.This combination business home office PC still completely okay Windows 10.Only change Windows 11 would made hardware update necessary sooner later ... accelerated defect , describe requirement profile , speak.And fulfills 13100f.I n't need onboard graphics , 3 monitors ca n't avoid graphics card anyway.The CPU comparatively cheap fast enough purposes.The low power hunger makes PC run almost silently promises long service life.Experience shown even undervolting improve things . fits cost -effective CPU purposes.I would call higher potential expensive processors anyway ."
